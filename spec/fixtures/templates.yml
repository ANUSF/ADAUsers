  title: Application for Access to Data
  body: |
    <p class="noprint">
      Please print and submit this form in order to gain access to data. Further instructions are provided below.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Australian Data Archive<br />
      The Australian National University<br />
      18 Balmain Crescent<br />
      Canberra ACT 0200<br />
      http://www.assda.edu.au
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>How to use this form</h2>
    
    <p></p>Completion of the form will give the signatory free access to download all of ASSDA’s General Access collection. Separate processes are required for restricted datasets.</p>
    <p>Things you should know…</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You must be a staff member or student of a current financial ACSPRI Institution to use 
        this form. This will be confirmed by ASSDA staff prior to access being granted.
        <ul>
          <li>For details of your membership status, go to the ACSPRI website at 
    http://www.acspri.org.au/ .</li>
          <li>If you are not a member of an ACSPRI Institution, you will have to sign a different 
    form, and pay a service charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The signatory must be registered with ASSDA. Access will be given to the ASSDA 
    account that matches the returned Undertaking form.</li>
      <li>
        You must recognise that we may need to give your details to the depositor. Depositors 
        can request this information to get an idea about secondary usage for future funding 
        purposes, or to make contact with researchers with similar interests. If this is problematic 
        for you, please contact the Requests Officer to discuss.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h2>Who Signs the Form?</h2>
    
    <p>The form can only be signed by someone who can be responsible for the use of the data. For
    example, a student can be responsible for their own use and could sign their own form, but couldn’t
    sign the form on behalf of a Professor. A Professor, however, can be responsible for his or her
    student’s use, and could sign on behalf of a class. In either of these instances, you should circle
    the category &quot;I&quot; on the form.</p>
    
    <p>The other two signatory categories &quot;The Department&quot; and &quot;The Organisation&quot; must only be circled
    when the signatory has the legal delegation to do so. For example a Head of Department could
    sign the form and make the data available to others within the Department.</p>
    
    <p>Fax the form to 02 6125 0627 or email a scanned copy to assda@anu.edu.au and mark it
    &quot;Attention Requests Officer&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>
      Then post the original to:
      <blockquote>

    <p>We will contact you by the email address you used for your ASSDA account when the form has
    been received and again when access has been granted.</p>
